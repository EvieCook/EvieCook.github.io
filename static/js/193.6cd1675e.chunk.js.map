This oven will successfully bake a cookie at the desired constant temperature of 350 degrees.</p>\n        <p>Using my understanding of the power and amps created by each power supply and switching device, I was able to properly place them together to function as one strong unit.

Recall that PID controller stands for Proportional, Integral, Derivative controller.  That is, the controller output of the PID algorithm is a sum of three terms, the proportional term, the integral term, and the derivative term.  You can see each term in the PID controller output equation below: </p>\n        <p>CO(t) = KP*e(t) + KI*âˆ«(e(t)dt) + KD*(de/dt)</p>\n        <p>In the above equation, CO(t) is the controller output, which is a function of time. e(t) is the error as a function of time, and KP, KI, and KD are the gains for each term. The PID algorithm uses not only the current error, but also the derivative and integral of the error over time to calculate the controller output. The controllers work in unison, heating the oven temperature controller to run the oven.</p>\n        <CaptionedImage image={labview2} caption=\"PID Controller\" maxHeight={72}/>\n        <CaptionedImage image={labview3} caption=\"PWM Controller\" maxHeight={72}/>\n        <CaptionedImage image={labview4} caption=\"Oven Temperature Controller\" maxHeight={72}/>\n        <p>Finally, after the oven reaches 350 degrees fahrenheit and bakes for a few minutes a successful cookie was produced!</p>\n        <CaptionedImage image={labview5} caption=\"Successful Cookie\" maxHeight={72}/>\n        <p></p>\n        </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default LabviewEasyBakeOven\n"],"names":["image","caption","alt","undefined","className","src","CaptionedImage","labview1","maxHeight","labview2","labview3","labview4","labview5"],"sourceRoot":""}
