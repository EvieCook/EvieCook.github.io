These classroom takeovers were held over ZOOM for about\n          an hour and included a small lesson plan discussing your topic of choice and an activity that followed a Colorado Education Requirement for\n          that grade. I decided to teach first grade about sound and how sound can make matter vibrate. We discussed the characteristics of waves, the\n          differences between load and soft waves, and how different animals have different speaking and hearing frequencies. To demonstrate that sound\n          can make matter vibrate, harmonicas were made.</p>\n        <CaptionedImage image={vCT1} caption=\"Colorado Teaching Standards\" maxHeight={72}/>\n        <CaptionedImage image={vCT2} caption=\"Harmonica Materials\" maxHeight={72}/>\n        </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default VirtualClassroomTeacher\n"],"names":["image","caption","alt","undefined","className","src","CaptionedImage","vCT1","maxHeight","vCT2"],"sourceRoot":""}
